# Build anything & Play games in CLOBLoX
CLOBLoX (Clone + Roblox) is a old roblox revival and clone.

# Where is CLOBLoX?
It's here! You need to download the Desktop App first.

We have two different mirror links, the GitHub Releases & a Google Drive link.

Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16rbXlp6Yb9SRS0BMgXj5nV_KtErIOSId/view?usp=sharing

GitHub: Go to Releases & find the latest release.

# Is there a web version?
Yes! It's from https://clarkplayobby.adalo.com/cloblox-official

# New style update is here
We upgraded the website design to a Old Windows UWP Roblox design.

Here what's look like:
